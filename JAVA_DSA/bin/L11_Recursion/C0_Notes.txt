# pre-requisites for Recursion
1. Functions
2. Memory Management.

# How memory management works for functions in java 
1. when a function is first called, it is added to stack memory and it remains there untill the function has stopped executing.
2. when a funciton is finished executing it is removed from the stack, and the flow of program is restored to where that fucntion was called.

# Recursion is basically when a function calls itself */

# Base Conditon: it is a condition in recursion where our recursion will stop
making new calls.

# Stack Overflow error: when stack mamory is filled with recursive fucntions
calls and waiting for next functions to be resolved.


# WHY RECURSION ?
1. It helps us in solving bigger and complex problems in a simple way.
2. it used to solve problems like Dynamic programming, Binary trees etc.
3. You can convert the recursion solution into iteration and vice-versa.
